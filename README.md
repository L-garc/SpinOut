# SpinOut
A game inspired by the 1987 game Spin Out. This work was created as an academic exercise and for use by professors as a teaching aid.
The main goal was to allow my Discrete Structures professor to better demonstrate recursion to her class, and to that end I have added some options for her.
This program is functional, though unpolished. I have further plans to improve it.
